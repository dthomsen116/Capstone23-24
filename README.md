# Accessibility Tools Database

## Github Repo: [Here](https://github.com/dthomsen116/Capstone23-24)

## Mission Statement:

This capstone project is driven by my commitment to advancing accessibility and inclusivity in both digital and physical settings. My mission is to develop a comprehensive framework or accessibility resource that caters to the unique needs of individuals with disabilities. Through diligent research, evaluation, and collaboration, I aim to create a more accessible digital world.

## Purpose:

The purpose of this database is to educate and provide information on accessibility applications and tools designed for people with various disabilities. I would also like to check the safety of the users that are looking to use these apps, making sure that they are secure.&#x20;

## Table of Contents:
