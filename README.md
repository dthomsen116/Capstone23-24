### Ideas so far

My two main ideas so far are centered around accessibility in the world of technology and cybersecurity. For many reasons I wanted to focus on accessibility and making sure that we are able to [design and implement cybersecurity measures to fit the needs of all individuals](https://securityintelligence.com/articles/importance-of-accessible-inclusive-cybersecurity/). The two areas I would like to explore is possible clientele work, where I would work with people with disabilities and build them workstations and computers that would be both fully functional, and secure. The other possible area I could explore is making sure that classrooms and labs, or even courses, are made with both the [UDL\*](https://udlguidelines.cast.org/) and the [WCAG\*\*](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) are kept in mind. 

### Deliverables

#### Clients
If I were to follow the path of clientele work, then the final deliverable would be a workstation that would allow a person with disabilities to access everything that a neurotypical person would have access to. Being a cyber security major, I would also focus on making this environment as secure as possible to ensure the safety of everyone who uses it.

#### Accessible classrooms and environments
If I were to look into classrooms and environments, the final deliverable would be reworking an existing lab, or help create a new lab where it would be fully accessible for anyone who enters the labs. This would be on both a physical level, as well as a computer-to-computer basis.

#### Additional thoughts

I believe it would also be possible to later combine these two ideas into making sure students with disabilities are able to access labs and classrooms with the same level of access and security as someone without a disability.
