# Summary of Goals and Ideas:

This capstone project focuses all around **Accessibiliy in Cybersecurity** and looks into databasing different accessibility tools as well as working with these tools in order to help people with disabilities interact with the digital world in the most effective ways. I plan to use this database and experience later in the semester in order to work with a client and create an environment for them that is both accessible and secure. Below I have listed the milestones that have been provided and links to the created work for each
