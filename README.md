## About

This capstone project is driven by my commitment to advancing accessibility and inclusivity in both digital and physical settings. My mission is to develop a comprehensive framework or accessibility resource that caters to the unique needs of individuals with disabilities. Through diligent research, evaluation, and collaboration, I aim to create a more accessible digital world.
