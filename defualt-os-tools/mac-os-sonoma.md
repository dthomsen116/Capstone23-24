# Mac OS Sonoma

## Visual Tools

***

## [VoiceOver](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/vision-mchl67c83f41/14.0/mac/14.0):

This is Apple's built in screen reader. It works very similarly to any other screen reader, however this is built into the OS, allowing the user to utilize the functionality of a screen reader, without the struggle to install an external application. It also has cross-compatibility with many braille displays which can allow for additional access.&#x20;

## [Display and Vision Controls](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/make-windows-easier-to-see-c97c2b0d-cadb-93f0-5fd1-59ccfe19345d#PickTab=Windows\_11):&#x20;

These controls are built in to slightly adjust the visual output and can allow the user to edit the size and color of text, apps, the cursor, and other items. There is also a built in zoom functionality similar to windows.&#x20;

## Hearing Features

## [Hearing Devices](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/hearing-mchlb4f015b1/14.0/mac/14.0):&#x20;





## Mobility Features

## [Voice Access](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/use-voice-access-to-control-your-pc-author-text-with-your-voice-4dcd23ee-f1b9-4fd1-bacc-862ab611f55d):&#x20;

This is a new feature to windows and allows the user to use tools and applications within the desktop without using a mouse or keyboard. Using just vocal commands in order to control the device allows those with motor disabilities to utilize the computers functions.&#x20;

## [Eye Control](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/get-started-with-eye-control-in-windows-1a170a20-1083-2452-8f42-17a7d4fe89a9#ID0EBD=Windows\_11):&#x20;

Windows has built in support for Eye Tracking Control of the device, which works similarly to voice access, but using eye motions instead. Specific eye-tracking cameras are necessary as are the drivers and software.  Besides set up, this would allow users who have motor disabilities that may have also damaged their vocal cords or speech patterns.&#x20;

## Neurodiversity Features:

## [Immersive Reader](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/use-immersive-reader-in-microsoft-edge-78a7a17d-52e1-47ee-b0ac-eff8539015e1):&#x20;

This immersive reader is a group of multiple different accessibility tools to help the user focus on the material that is being read. This allows full customization of the text preferences (size, spacing, font, style, etc), Grammar tools such as highlighting different parts of speech or syllables, a line focus reader, which can limit the amount of lines that are highlighted to limit stimulation from the page, and a picture dictionary that shows picture definitions of highlighted words. Overall, all of these allow for customization that enables focus for those who may struggle with attention disorders.&#x20;

## [Focus Sessions](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/make-it-easier-to-focus-on-tasks-0d259fd9-e9d0-702c-c027-007f0e78eaf2#ID0EBD=Windows\_11\&WindowsVersion=Windows\_11):&#x20;

Focus Sessions are a way to limit the amount of function the device has while someone may be working on an assignment. Setting up a focus session can be utilized to remove access to other applications and minimize distractions for a set time while a user is working.&#x20;
