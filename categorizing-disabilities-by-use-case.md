These are much more general access tools for people before they are able to install or customize other applications. These can include but are not limited to:

* Narrator - A text-to-speech software built into most OS
* Magnifier - A tool built into windows that works as a digital magnifying glass
* Speech Recognition - Allows the user to type using a microphone and spoken words rather than a keyboard.&#x20;
* Access Center - Windows, Mac, and Linux (Ubuntu) has a center for further accessibility settings that can include high contrast, keyboard settings, or audio and visual settings.&#x20;

There are also tools that are meant to help everyone regardless of any disabilities and I have categorized these through general access. This can include:

* Web Accessibility Checkers: Software that assess websites for accessibility compliance.
* Voice Assistants: Virtual assistants like Microsoft Cortana, Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, or Apple's Siri, which can assist with various tasks.
* Universal Design Concepts: Guidelines and principles for designing products and services that are accessible to as many people as possible.
* Screen Recording and Captioning Software: Tools that record and add captions to video content for greater accessibility.

There are a near infinite amount of tools for visual impairment as it is a relatively common disability, so there are multiple styles of tools and applications to help the user.&#x20;

* Screen Readers - Software that will read the contents of the screen aloud for the user to hear.
* Screen Magnification - Software to magnify and enhance the size of the content on screen.
* Braille Translation Software - This will take text and convert it into braille for the user.
* OCR (Optical Character Recognition) Software - This will take content from printed texts or pdfs that are unable to be scanned with other software.
